# Plans index

The one-minute "what's in flight" view. Read this first each session instead of re-deriving
state from `git log`. Completed plans move to `done/`.

**Next free number: 0025** (ADRs are a separate sequence; next free there is **0019**).

## Active roster

<!-- roster:begin cap=320 -->
| Plan | Title | Status | Live constraint |
|------|-------|--------|-----------------|
| [0020](0020-cavern-reverb-directional-echoes-and-gliding-taps.md) | Cavern reverb: a late tail sized by the room the listener sees, echoes from their walls, taps that glide, and the player's own voice in the cave | approved | M4, paired with ADR-0015. After Plan 0006 closes; takes over its moving-click finding. |
| [0022](0022-a-falling-region-crushes-sub-threshold-voxels.md) | A falling region crushes the sub-threshold voxels under it and piles them as rubble, and the logic tells a wedge from a refusal and a landing | approved | M8, paired with ADR-0016 (proposed). Approved 2026-10-20; dev lane in a worktree. |
| [0023](0023-render-thread-cpu-attribute-hitch-and-streaming-line.md) | The render thread's mirror CPU: profile a chunk crossing, then cut the attribute hitch and the streaming line with targeted fixes | approved | M2, before lighting; ADR-0017 (proposed). Dev starts when the 0020 or 0022 lane is at its human phase. |
| [0024](0024-direct-light-hit-buffer-emissive-samples-and-svgf-denoiser.md) | Direct light: a hit buffer, emissive voxels as light samples, one shadow ray per pixel, and an SVGF-family denoiser whose history dies in edit boxes | draft | M2, ADR-0018 (proposed). After Plan 0023 closes; before the mirror-slot plan. |

## Conventions

- One plan per milestone slice, numbered when drafted, never reserved ahead.
- A row carries at most two sentences of live constraint. What landed and why belongs in the
  plan file.
- A closed plan leaves this table; `done/` records it.
